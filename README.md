# nisx

Yet another *enis* implementation, an electronic school journal. 

> *enis* is a common name for custom 3rd-party clients built for an electronic school diary/journal used in NIS (Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools).

# Issues

The known issue is that NIS servers don't have a public API, therefore I had to build an interlayer between the web client and the NIS servers to circumvent the CORS policy.
